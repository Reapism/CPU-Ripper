# What is CPU Ripper?
The CPU Ripper is a tool which tests your CPU in various data structures
and operations single and multithreaded. CPU Ripper is powered by WPF in C#.

# How does it work?
You select a fixed number of iterations for each test and then it performs
the tests and averages the results against a base level CPU [TBD] and 
generates a score from 0 to 100.

**50** being the average case.

**100** being the absolute best case.
